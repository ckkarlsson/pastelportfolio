           <div class="content"><h2>Overview</h2>
           <p>The Ode To is a Swedish and Amsterdam based e-commerce company that acts as the middle man between the
            artist and the buyer with the goal to remove the fancier mark of buying unique art. Anyone who is interested 
            should be able to buy art.  
        </p>

           <div class="content"><h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>As The Ode to grew it became increasingly important to expand the overall experience of their website. With products that keep on growing the display of the design and navigation was utmost important as well as enhancing the performance of the site. </p>
        
            <p>The initial outcome was to improve and redesign the navigation system and FAQ, apply new features that would fit the current feel and design, build a content interface for their digital exhibition's and boost the site's SEO.

            <div class="content"><h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <h4>The Navigation</h4>
            <p>The most prioritized goal with this project was to make the navigation system more user friendly 
                and make the potential buyer have a pleasant and smooth journey during their visit at the site no matter the device.</p>
            <h4>The FAQ</h4>
            <p>text</p>

            <h4>New Features</h4>
            <p>text</p>

            <h4>Content Interface</h4>
            <p>The Company's CEO had personally requested that the site would have a content interface for their upcoming digital exhibitions and it was my responsibility to design and build one they could use and re-use in the future that would fit with the
                 overall design of the website and company brand.</p>

            <h4>SEO</h4>
            <p>With the large quantity of products, images, content and old plug-ins there was no surprise that the site speed was quite slow and the first indication that the SEO had to be improved. The goal was to identify what exactly slowed down the site performance, 
                make it more accessible and perform better on Google.</p>
